# Databases---CS-505
#Two projects

#Mixed Security Model
An implementation of “Mixed Security model” in databases in Python. Granularity of the security model is on table level and we assume only one type of privilege is present. The software demonstrates the logic behind how a combination of Discretionary Access Control and Mandatory Access Control works on top of a database system.

#Columnar Distribution Architecture
An implementation of “Columnar Distribution Architecture” in databases in Python. This involves a two part implementation. A lossless decomposition of tables in to two- attribute tables and SQL query processing pertaining to the tables maintained as columnar distribution. We strictly assume a format for entering data for the tables and only simple queries are accepted.
